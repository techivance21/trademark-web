        <p>
          Thank you for choosing Legal Mark Experts, a private trademark law firm based in New York. We serve businesses
          across the United States with a singular focus on trademark registration for brand names, logos, and slogans.
          By using our services, you agree to our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Fee Agreement, and all applicable

        <p>
          Legal Mark Experts represents clients on a limited-scope basis for U.S. trademark matters unless otherwise
          agreed in writing. Until we complete a conflict check and formally confirm representation, you are considered a
          prospective client. Once accepted, we represent only the named client. For corporate clients, our engagement
          does not extend to individual officers, owners, or affiliates in their personal capacity.
